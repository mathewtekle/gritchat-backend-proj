# gritchat-backend-proj

# Description:
This proj allows a user to check if a file exists and if so, returns the file contents back to the user in a JSON format (This project functions on the assumptions that all
files requested have a .txt extension). If I were to expand on this, I'd write multiple routes to ensure that I would know what file type is being looked for so that the corresponding extension is added.


# Instructions:
1. Type "run npm dev" to launch the project
2. To test further files, place within project directory.
